    caption: "Robots actively select informative interactions to accelerate learning."
    description: |
      We develop active learning methods that enable robots to strategically select which interactions or queries will most efficiently improve their performance. This approach dramatically reduces the amount of data required for learning new tasks.

      Our algorithms balance exploration of uncertain states with exploitation of known strategies, optimizing the learning process.

      Applications include learning manipulation skills, navigation policies, and object recognition in novel environments.

    caption: "Seamlessly integrating human feedback into the robot learning process."
    description: |
      We design systems that allow non-expert humans to provide effective feedback to robots during learning. This includes preference learning, correction signals, and demonstration interfaces.

      Our research addresses challenges in interpreting ambiguous human feedback and aligning robot behavior with human intentions.

      The resulting systems enable rapid skill acquisition and personalization to individual user preferences.

    caption: "Sharing learned knowledge across heterogeneous robot platforms."
    description: |
      We investigate methods for transferring learned policies and representations across different robot morphologies and capabilities. This enables fleets of heterogeneous robots to benefit from collective experience.

      Our approach addresses domain adaptation challenges arising from differences in sensors, actuators, and dynamics.

      We've demonstrated successful transfer between manipulators with different degrees of freedom and between wheeled and legged platforms.
