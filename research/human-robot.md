    caption: "Predicting human actions and goals from partial observations."
    description: |
      We develop models that enable robots to infer human intentions from observable behavior, allowing for proactive assistance and seamless collaboration. Our methods combine Bayesian inference with deep learning for robust prediction.

      The system can reason about hierarchical goals and subgoals, adapting its behavior based on its understanding of human objectives.

      Applications include collaborative assembly, co-manipulation tasks, and assistive robotics.

    caption: "Ensuring safety during physical human-robot contact."
    description: |
      We design control frameworks that guarantee safety during physical human-robot interaction. Our methods include real-time collision detection, compliant control, and risk-aware planning.

      The research addresses both intentional physical guidance and unexpected contacts, ensuring robot behavior remains safe under all conditions.

      We've validated these approaches in manufacturing, healthcare, and domestic assistance scenarios.

    caption: "Dynamic allocation of control between human and robot partners."
    description: |
      We develop shared autonomy systems that dynamically adjust the level of robot assistance based on context, user performance, and stated preferences. This enables fluid collaboration where control authority shifts appropriately.

      Our frameworks incorporate models of human capability and preference to provide the right type and amount of assistance.

      Applications include teleoperation, assistive devices, and complex task execution where human expertise complements robotic capabilities.
